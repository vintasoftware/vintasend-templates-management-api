"""Who may call ``/api/v1``.

Two ways, chosen by settings, both read per request so ``override_settings`` works:

``VINTASEND_API_AUTHENTICATOR`` -- ``(request) -> None``
    A host's own check, as a dotted path or as the callable itself. It refuses a caller by
    raising ``ApiError("UNAUTHORIZED", ...)`` (401, no valid credential) or
    ``ApiError("FORBIDDEN", ...)`` (403, a caller it knows and refuses); returning lets the
    request through. It may be ``async``. When it is set, the shared key is not checked and
    need not be configured. ``bearer_token`` reads the header for one built around a token
    the host verifies itself, such as its identity provider's.

``VINTASEND_API_KEY``
    The shared secret, when no authenticator is set: every request must carry
    ``Authorization: Bearer <VINTASEND_API_KEY>``. A UI in front of this API is expected to
    call it from its own server side, so the key never reaches a browser.

Neither says who the caller is: attribution stays with ``MANAGED_TEMPLATE_ACTOR_RESOLVER``.
