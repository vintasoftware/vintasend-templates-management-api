"""Minimal CORS support for the ``/api/v1`` prefix.

A UI is expected to call this API from its own server side, so CORS is off by default and
most deployments never turn it on. When ``VINTASEND_API_CORS_ORIGINS`` is set, only the
listed origins are echoed back -- never ``*`` -- because every request carries a bearer
token and a wildcard would let any page on the internet spend it.

A dedicated middleware rather than ``django-cors-headers``: the whole policy is the three
headers below, and a browser-facing deployment needs a per-user auth layer in front of
this API anyway.
