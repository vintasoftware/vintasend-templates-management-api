"""How a JSON route reads its request body.

Every request body in the contract is ``application/json``. The rule for anything else:

* A request that declares a JSON media type (``application/json`` or
  ``application/*+json``) must carry valid JSON. An empty body there is malformed.
* A request that declares no media type, or another one, is read as ``{}`` when its body
  is empty. That is what lets an all-optional body be omitted. A non-empty body like that
  is refused rather than guessed at.

Refusing beats guessing either way. Reading such a body as JSON anyway (Ninja's default)
accepts a request the contract does not describe. Reading it as ``{}`` is worse: on the
lifecycle routes ``{}`` means "act on the latest version", so
``curl -d '{"version": 2}'`` -- form-encoded unless told otherwise -- would archive the
latest version instead of v2, and archiving cannot be undone.

Every refusal is a 400 ``BAD_REQUEST`` with ``details.issues`` at the empty path, the same
envelope as any other invalid input.
